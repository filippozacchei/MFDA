# Deep Learning & Multi-Fidelity MCMC for Uncertainty Quantification

## Introduction
This project integrates deep learning with multi-fidelity models to enhance uncertainty quantification using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. It aims to provide efficient and accurate uncertainty estimates by combining information from various model fidelities.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the dependencies to set up your environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:filippozacchei/Deep-UQ.git
